# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, and early detection can significantly improve health outcomes. By leveraging data science, we seek to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals efficiently and accurately.

## üß† Problem Statement

Heart disease is a major global health concern. Many at-risk individuals remain undiagnosed until it's too late. Early intervention can save lives. Our goal is to use patient medical records to train and evaluate predictive models that can detect heart disease early.

## üéØ Project Aim

- Build a classification model to detect heart disease.
- Use both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance before and after dimensionality reduction.
- Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy and generalization.
- Provide insights into feature importance for medical interpretability.
